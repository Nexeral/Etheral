    <p>Jeremy Hucklins</p>
    <p>Once in a time lived an old man. His name was Jerry Hicklin. Jerry was 51 years during that time. The ancient times was during a war. Jerry was always extremely tensed about himself. He never made a loud sound during the war. He always thought terrorists would always catch him through normal activities. ”Run in the garden, RUN NOW!!!”a loud sound that Jerry heard when he was just preparing for a fresh sleep. “RUN!!!!!Before we die” came a loud voice and Jerry on the other hand dropped his clothes when he heard this. Jerry felt like his blood just jumped and went out from his body. All of a sudden he heard a crack downstairs. Slowly walking towards bedroom Jerry was shaking. He thought the soldiers are hiding but he heard large gunshots. Jerry gave up and started running as fast as he could. He took a kar98 from his cupboard where he hides it and pointed at the door because he thought someone would jump in and attack him. But just as Jerry was about to shoot a soldier broke in his house and said to Jerry silently “We are under control Jerry, We need to find an exit so no enemies can barge in and shoot us. Jerry slowly went out and escaped through window. They almost escaped when some new year soldiers came and shot the soldier who was with Jerry. He got shot 4 times on his chest and he didn`t care as he was fighting really badly with death. At a worst moment the soldier fell on the ground and prayed. “Oh God, I can`t refuse death, I must accept death, but before I pass away, I will trade this life to protect my country at any cost, please sent a brave and admiring soldier to protect this country and inspire the whole nation, I might not be there but brothers who will be there will remember me, I`m now ready for death. Thank you for this life”. He passed away on the window. Jerry escaped and travelled from one place to another hour by hour. When he is about to give up he remembers his words “Don`t give up, it`s going to be worth to your life”. Jerry was free but as he was 51, he was suffering from breathing difficulties. Jerry fell down and relaxed for a moment and heard extremely loud gunshots coming towards him and he almost felt like he was running out of breath when few soldiers came and rescued him from this situation. Jerry was very tried all of a sudden and he felt heavy blocks standing on his chests while the soldiers took him to the hospital. He rested peacefully for a few minutes until his daughter Mary came said his grandson has passed away. Jerry`s Grandson Harold was just a few months aged while he died. Jerry cried and he felt like this day was the worst day of his entire life. He thought this war was going to last a few weeks and then end but this turned into a great stressful day. Jerry never realised he should have just moved to London with his brother Richard and this stressful thing would have never happened .But he regrets this moment. A year later on the war ended. Jerry was 52 and was in the hospital suffering from chest pain and a bad headache. After a few moments Jerry went to coma. His body was cold as a November night and his chest was even more colder than his other cold parts. Many things happened during these years Jerry was in coma. The doctor always checked him everyday to see if he had died or is he even alive. One night a bunch of terrorists attacked and raided many hospitals and killed a lot of innocent individuals. The hospital jerry was in was also raided but even badly. Jerry`s cabin was protected by his son in law as he was a soldier. David Stucklins and Thomas Adler were brave fighters who fought to protect many large companies and had earned a lot of respect and cash. They also fought and survived from world war 2. The hospital Jerry was in was known as St. Kimberlin. The hospital was badly attacked. Thomas’s left leg was injured. The way the terrorists attacked felt like an action movie. But it was a worse situation for the brave fighters. We don`t know how the warriors feel until we actually fight it. When Jerry finally woke up from coma at the age of 63 at 1978. His daughter Mary confronted him and said you were in coma for a lot of years and in these years the hospital was raided. “What in the whole muffin cream happened when I was in coma. And am I even in heaven or what” shouted Jerry. “Calm down father. The brave soldiers sacrificed their life to save you” said Mary. Jerry came into tears when he heard both  young David and Thomas fought with death and fought for Jerry during this time. Mary also said the hospital was on fire. Only this cabin survived. In 1989 loud crying came from Mary, Jerry had passed away from Heart attack. And Mary gave birth when Jerry was in coma. Jerry`s grandson who survived was named John Stade. John was a young and handsome boy. He always dreamt of being like the both David and Thomas who were famous for their sacrifice for and old blood. John didn`t like Jerry because he was very shameful and a coward. Even though John was named on Jerry`s family he still hated him for his personality. John learned to use Guns at the age of 9 to protect. He always wanted to understand what Jerry wanted to do but Mary said your grandfather was a great man, don`t hate him for his personality. On a golden sunset in a blossom spring, John finally became legal. He was excited to finally be independent. He wrote many books after being inspired by Shakespeare’s Macbeth. He always thought about writing something which people liked much. He also had a cat named Arnold. John`s book was rated 0/10 by people who read it. When people said him to improve he was just being hypocrite. He never cared what people said. One day John thought of making a story about his cat Arnold. He spend 1 whole day to wrote it in every detail his cat acts. He called this book Arnold acts which became popular in the areas of England and London. A few years later Mary also passed away and John cried the most in his life. He travelled from place to place with map on deserts and many more islands. He never ignored his mother`s word “Just wait and travel far as you can”. And when he finally reached the highest mountain he felt like there is nothing he needs to succeed in life. And when he is about to travel, he slipped away and fell on the soft snow under the mountain. As he looked at his map he saw it being ripped into half. He groaned in pain. “Shit, Should have memorised the map” said this being lost under the highest mountain. He never thought that succeeding in life will also led to a worse situation. High mountains and soft cold snow surrounding John. After a few moments John managed to built up a fire which went out asap. He was shivering from coldness and almost froze which so much freezing cold snow. It was snowing so much that at a moment John passed away on the surface not being able to choose an option without giving up. The Hicklin family`s journey ended before another successful child who will succeed.</p>
